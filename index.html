    <!--This is a section about Skirt Steak-->
<section class="steakchild">
   <h3>What Is Skirt Steak?</h3>
    <p>Inside and outside skirt are pretty similar; both are long, flat muscles with very thick grain that runs across the length of the muscle. These narrow pieces of meat can be about 20 to 24 inches long and three to four inches across once they've been trimmed.</p>

    <!--This is a section about Porterhouse Steak-->
<section class="steakchild">
    <h3>What Is Porterhouse Steak?</h3>
    <p>The porterhouse is a composite steak that's derived from the point where the tenderloin and top loin meet. If you remove the bone and cut out the two steaks that make up the porterhouse, you get a tenderloin steak and a top loin.
    </p>

    <!--This is a section about Club Steak -->
<section class="steakchild">
    <h3>What Is Club Steak?</h3>
    <p>A triangular strip steak with an L-shaped bone, club steak comes from the smaller front part of the short loin, nearest the rib. The juicy, well-marbled meat of a club steak is the same section of strip steak you find on a T-bone or porterhouse, but the club steak does not contain any portion of tenderloin.</p>

<section class="steakchild">
        <h3>What Is Denver Steak?</h3>
        <p>Denver steaks are made from the serratus ventralis muscle, which comes from the under blade portion of the chuck roll.  Most of the muscles in the beef chuck are pretty tough. The serratis ventralis, however, is one of the exceptions; it's situated directly underneath the shoulder blade bone and doesn't get used much. This makes it one of the more tender muscles in the beef chuck. </p>
